# Test Automation with Cypress

Created as a learning exercise to experiment with the JavaScript end to end (E2E) testing framework [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The application under test is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app.



## Test Automation with Protractor

At the time of developing the application, I also wrote automated front-end and component level tests using the behaviour driven JavaScript testing framework [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) along with [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) to automate the browser and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) as the test runner.  These tests can be found [here](https://github.com/haguezo/t-outcomes-protractor).
